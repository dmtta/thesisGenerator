Download zip, change folder name from Thesis Generator master to "ThesisGenerator"

Click start to generate first sentence

Click on keywords near bottom of screen then press "add node" to save keyword as node

Alternatively, write with keyboard, press enter, then "add node" to save as node (all new strings get saved in NEWWORDS.txt)

Clicking on "another" generates new phrase
